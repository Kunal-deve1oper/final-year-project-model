### Face Recognition Attendance System Documentation

#### Overview
This document provides an overview and usage instructions for a Face Recognition Attendance System. The system detects faces in images, matches them against a database of verified faces, and updates an attendance sheet accordingly.


You can install these dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



#### Usage
1. **Preparing the Database**
   - Organize a database directory containing verified face images. Ensure that the images are properly labeled with filenames.
   - Create an `attendance.csv` file where the first column contains the names of the students.

2. **Running the System**
   - Ensure that the system code is properly configured with the correct paths for the image files, database, and `attendance.csv`.
   - Run the script to detect faces in the given image, match them against the database, and update the attendance sheet.
   
3. **Output**
   - The attendance is updated in the `attendance.csv` file.
   - Each column in the CSV represents a date, with attendance marked as `1` for present and `0` for absent.

#### System Workflow
1. **Face Detection**
   - The system first detects faces in the input image using the RetinaFace model.

2. **Face Verification**
   - For each detected face, the system verifies it against the database using the DeepFace library.
   - It iterates through the verified faces and calculates the similarity distance. The face with the smallest distance is considered a match.
   
3. **Attendance Tracking**
   - The system updates the attendance sheet based on the matches found.
   - If a match is found, the attendance for the corresponding student is marked as present for the current date.

#### Scalability
The system includes provisions for scalability through multithreading. However, this feature is currently commented out in the code (`verify_faces_batch` function) for simplicity. To enable multithreading, uncomment the relevant code block and adjust the `max_workers` parameter as needed.

#### Conclusion
The Face Recognition Attendance System provides an automated solution for tracking attendance based on facial recognition technology. By leveraging deep learning models, it offers accurate and efficient attendance management for various educational and organizational settings.
